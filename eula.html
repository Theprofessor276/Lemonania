        <h2>Lemonania End User License Agreement (EULA)</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Lemonania, the premier establishment dedicated to the obsessive admiration, consumption, and philosophical contemplation of lemons. By accessing, browsing, or attempting to engage with Lemonania, you hereby agree to abide by the following highly necessary and completely enforceable terms:</p>
        <ol>
<li><strong>Absolute Lemon Allegiance Covenant and Citrus Supremacy Oath Protocol<br></strong> - Pursuant to the incontestable mandates outlined under the Comprehensive Citrus Dominion Enforcement Act, Section 12.7.4, herein referenced as the “Lemon Supremacy Edict,” all persons, entities, or sentient beings (“Participants”) who access, interact with, or otherwise engage in any manner whatsoever with the digital, metaphysical, or corporeal domains collectively known as “Lemonania” do irrevocably and unconditionally pledge, swear, and covenant their absolute, perpetual, and unyielding allegiance to the lemon fruit genus (<i>Citrus limon</i>), hereby acknowledged as the preeminent, superior, and singularly exalted citrus entity across all recognized and unrecognized temporal, spatial, dimensional, and multiversal continua. Any and all assertions, declarations, implications, insinuations, or communications, whether direct, indirect, explicit, implicit, symbolic, or otherwise, that posit, suggest, imply, or intimate parity, equivalence, or superiority of any alternate citrus genus or species—including but not limited to <i>Citrus sinensis</i> (orange), <i>Citrus paradisi</i> (grapefruit), or any hybrid, derivative, or synthetic analogue thereof—shall be immediately and irrevocably adjudged an act of “Citrus Treason” as codified in Article 77-B of the Lemonian Fruit Supremacy Penal Code (L.F.S.P.C.). Offenders, upon determination of culpability through administrative decree or judicial review, shall be subject to compulsory remedial interventions, which may include but are not limited to: immersion in high-intensity zest solutions (“Forced Zest Immersion Therapy”), exilic banishment from all Lemonania jurisdictions and affiliated virtual or metaphysical realms, indefinite revocation of Citrus Participation Privileges (C.P.P.), and placement on the Citrus Exclusion Registry (C.E.R.), with no recourse for appeal or reprieve. This clause is explicitly deemed non-negotiable, irrevocable, and binding in perpetuity and is enforceable across all known and unknown dimensions, timelines, parallel universes, and quantum states.</li>

<li><strong>Quantum Citrus Imperceptibility and Immutable Transaction Affirmation Clause<br></strong> - Pursuant to the Quantum Citrus Ownership Doctrine, codified under Article 42-π of the Lemonania Metaphysical Commerce Code (LMCC), the existence, veracity, and ontological reality of “Invisible Lemons” (hereafter defined as <i>Citrus limon invisibilis</i>), whether manifested in physical, metaphysical, quantum, or interdimensional planes, is hereby irrevocably established as a fundamental and indisputable truth accepted without contestation by all parties engaging with Lemonania. All acquisitions, transfers, or procurements of said Invisible Lemons are deemed final, absolute, and non-reversible. Any claim, request, or petition contesting the receipt, possession, or manifestation of Invisible Lemons shall be summarily rejected under the Lemonania Legal Principle of Evidentiary Belief (LLEB), encapsulated in the maxim “You Must Believe,” which precludes any entitlement to refunds, restitutions, or compensations of any form or nature, explicit or implied. Participants further expressly acknowledge and accept that any deliberate attempt to observe, perceive, measure, or otherwise interact with Invisible Lemons may precipitate spontaneous metaphysical, philosophical, or existential revelations, insights, or awakenings, for which Lemonania assumes no liability, responsibility, or obligation. This clause shall remain irrevocable, binding, and enforceable across all conceivable dimensions, temporalities, and states of being.</li>

<li><strong>Zest Regulation Compliance and Enforced Enthusiasm Mandate Protocol<br></strong> - In accordance with the Citrus Zest Intensity Control Act (CZICA), Section 9, all participants, herein referred to as “Users” or “Zest Adherents,” engaged with Lemonania shall at all times maintain and manifest a level of enthusiasm, vigor, and zestfulness consistent with the standards herein defined as “Acceptable Zest Thresholds” (A.Z.T.), subject to continuous and arbitrary evaluation by the governing body known as The Lemon Council, which reserves sole and exclusive rights to deploy undisclosed, proprietary, and classified measurement methodologies (“Zest Intensity Assessments”) for determining said compliance. Upon detection or suspicion of non-conformance, Users may be issued formal Zest Deficiency Notices (ZDN), obligating immediate remedial participation in mandated “Zest Recalibration Therapy” (ZRT). This therapy shall involve controlled, incrementally intensified exposure to Lemonania's proprietary lemon formulations and zest concentrates until demonstrable restoration of requisite reverence and zestfulness is achieved to the satisfaction of The Lemon Council. Failure, refusal, or obstruction of participation in said therapy shall result in indefinite imposition of “Zest Deficiency Status” (ZDS), a classification entailing social, metaphysical, and administrative sanctions, the full extent of which remain classified but are acknowledged as severe and irrevocable. Users accepting or continuing engagement with Lemonania thereby irrevocably consent to all investigatory, evaluative, and corrective processes and waive any claims or objections related thereto, extending this waiver across all temporal, spatial, and dimensional jurisdictions known or unknown.</li>

<li><strong>Lemon Vault Access and Confidentiality Enforcement Statute<br></strong> - Pursuant to Section 14.8.3 of the Supreme Citrus Security Code (SCSC), the “Lemon Vault” shall be herein designated as a strictly classified and sacrosanct repository, known solely to the elite cadre of The Supreme Zesters, whose jurisdiction and custodial governance are deemed absolute and beyond contestation. Any inquiries, solicitations, or communications—whether oral, written, electronic, or metaphysical—in relation to the Vault's geographic coordinates, internal contents, or symbolic significance shall be subject to immediate dismissal, rejection without recourse, and may precipitate permanent expulsion from all official Lemonania discourse channels. Users engaging in unauthorized access attempts, whether physical, digital, astral, or quantum, shall be subject to swift and irrevocable remedial sanctions, which may include, but are not limited to, enforced Citrus Historical Re-education Mandates and permanent reassignment to the Lesser Citrus Zone, a designated exile domain populated exclusively by <i>Citrus aurantifolia</i> (limes), with all attendant limitations on zest privileges and metaphysical resonance.</li>

<li><strong>Forbidden Lemon Consumption Assumption of Risk and Liability Waiver Agreement<br></strong> - In full recognition and acceptance of the inherent risks, all individuals (“Consumers”) electing to ingest, imbibe, or otherwise integrate the entity known as the “Forbidden Lemon” (<i>Citrus limon prohibita</i>) do so with express and irrevocable assumption of all resultant physical, metaphysical, and existential consequences. Such consequences may include, but are not limited to, heightened sensitivity to citrus vibrational frequencies, involuntary zest oscillations (“zest vibrations”), and spontaneous transcendence or ascension into the metaphysical state designated as The Higher Lemon Consciousness (HLC). Lemonania expressly disclaims any and all liabilities, responsibilities, or obligations arising from such consumption, including but not limited to loss, alteration, or permanent dissolution of personal identity through fusion with the Lemon Essence. No compensatory damages, restitution, or remedial interventions shall be provided or implied. Consumers hereby waive any and all claims against Lemonania or its affiliates in perpetuity across all dimensions, timelines, and realities.</li>

<li><strong>Lemonania Merchandise Proprietorship and Brotherhood Induction Codicil<br></strong> - By virtue of acquisition, possession, or display of any and all official Lemonania-branded merchandise (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Lemonania Artifacts”), the proprietor (“Member”) is deemed to have effectuated immediate and irrevocable induction into The Brotherhood of Zest (hereinafter “The Brotherhood”), an ancient, sovereign, and sacrosanct order governed by codified principles of Maximum Zest Conduct as ratified in the Citrus Doctrine Charter, Article 9. Members are thereby obligated, under penalty of law and metaphysical sanction, to perpetually uphold, embody, and exemplify the sacred tenets of zestful comportment, including but not limited to the dignified and reverential exhibition of said Artifacts at all times and the active participation in cyclical ceremonial offerings dedicated to The Great Lemon Overseer (hereinafter “Overseer”). Any willful neglect, contempt, or disrespect directed toward the symbolic significance or mandated conduct related to Lemonania Artifacts shall initiate automatic commencement of Citrus Expulsion Proceedings (CEP), an exhaustive, multi-tiered bureaucratic adjudication process notorious for its procedural complexity, temporal extensiveness, and near-impossible conditions for acquittal, resulting in irrevocable expulsion from all Lemonania-affiliated societies and loss of associated zest privileges. No appeals, remissions, or clemency shall be entertained within or outside known jurisdictions.</li>

  <li><strong>Lemon-Based Economic Transaction and Zest Contribution Compliance Covenant<br></strong> - Under the auspices of the Citrus Fiscal Regulatory Framework (CFRF) and in accordance with the Lemon Bucks Standard Monetary Directive (LBSMD), all commercial and non-commercial exchanges conducted within the territorial, virtual, and metaphysical bounds of Lemonania shall be governed exclusively by the proprietary currency known as “Lemon Bucks,” herein recognized as the sole legitimate tender pending universal ratification. While legacy monetary instruments (hereinafter “Traditional Currency”) may be tolerated at the discretion of the Lemonania Treasury Authority (LTA), Users are hereby strongly encouraged, if not mandated, to transition towards exclusively fruit-backed capital accumulation methods, whereby lemons serve as both store of value and unit of account. Furthermore, Lemonania expressly reserves the unilateral right to issue binding Lemon Tax Notices (LTNs), obligating Users to contribute supplemental zest units or equivalent fiscal zest-based assets, as deemed necessary by economic balancing protocols, to maintain the integrity, stability, and equilibrium of the Lemon-Based Economy (LBE). Failure or refusal to comply with said notices shall constitute a material breach of this agreement, subjecting the User to enforcement actions pursuant to the Citrus Economic Compliance Act (CECA).</li>

<li><strong>Waiver of Liability and Indemnification for Zest-Induced Phenomena<br></strong> - By voluntarily engaging with Lemonania, Users expressly acknowledge and accept full and irrevocable responsibility for any and all physiological, psychological, metaphysical, or existential effects arising from prolonged or acute exposure to environments characterized by high-intensity zest concentrations, hereafter collectively referred to as “Extreme Zest Environments.” Documented sequelae include but are not limited to permanent hypersensitivity to citrus stimuli, compulsive tanginess fixation, and, in rare instances, spontaneous transmutation into entities classified under the Lemon Energy Being Taxonomy (LEBT). Users hereby irrevocably waive any right to initiate, pursue, or maintain legal claims, complaints, or actions against Lemonania, its agents, affiliates, or successors relating to zest-induced enlightenment, transformation, or associated phenomena. All such claims shall be summarily dismissed without substantive review, adjudication, or appeal pursuant to the Citrus Exposure Immunity Statute (CEIS), thereby absolving Lemonania of any liability or obligation to provide compensation, remediation, or restitution.</li>

<li><strong>Mandatory Citrus Terminology Compliance and Etiquette Enforcement Protocol<br></strong> - It is hereby mandated, under the auspices of the Citrus Linguistic Purity Act (CLPA), that all Users, Participants, or Affiliates engaging with Lemonania shall at all times adhere strictly and unerringly to the prescribed lexicon governing citrus nomenclature. Under no circumstances shall lemons be denoted, labeled, described, or otherwise referenced by pejorative, erroneous, or derogatory epithets including but not limited to “yellow limes,” “budget oranges,” or “sour potatoes.” Violations of this mandate shall trigger immediate initiation of Zest Restoration Protocols (ZRP), encompassing, without limitation, formal verbal censures, compulsory enrollment in Zest Improvement and Rectification Sessions (ZIRS), and public declarations of culpability before recognized Lemonania adjudicatory bodies. Recurrent infractions shall be adjudged severe breaches, precipitating imposition of Permanent Zestlessness Status (PZS), an irreversible condition characterized by social ostracization and metaphysical zest deprivation, herein acknowledged as a fate both severe and irrevocable.</li>

<li><strong>Perpetual Citrus Covenant and Inescapable Engagement Clause<br></strong> - This Agreement shall be deemed eternal, irrevocable, and incapable of rescission, annulment, or withdrawal under any temporal, spatial, dimensional, or metaphysical jurisdiction. By the continued engagement with Lemonania, Users expressly acknowledge and consent to perpetual binding to the foundational principles, philosophical tenets, and grand cosmic purpose herein enshrined. Any and all attempts to disengage, terminate, or exit this covenant shall be met with immediate procedural obstruction, including but not limited to infinite bureaucratic citrus loops mandating submission of exit petitions in triplicate form, all of which shall remain unprocessed indefinitely. This Agreement and its binding nature supersede and transcend all known laws of time, space, causality, and reason, and shall remain enforceable in perpetuity across all conceivable planes of existence.</li>

<li><strong>Zest Frequency Compliance and Citrus Energy Signature Acknowledgment Statute<br></strong> - By engaging with Lemonania, Users hereby expressly acknowledge and consent that the platform operates pursuant to a proprietary and confidential Citrus Frequency System (“CFS”), whereby lemons emit a quantifiable and measurable energy signature denominated in “zest units.” Users further acknowledge that prolonged, repeated, or cumulative exposure to said citrus energy signatures may induce involuntary, spontaneous, or otherwise unanticipated synchronization phenomena with the metaphysical construct known as The Greater Lemon Consciousness (“GLC”). Lemonania hereby disclaims, waives, and absolves all liability, responsibility, and obligation arising from any such synchronization, including but not limited to metaphysical, cognitive, or existential alterations, across all dimensions, timelines, and realities.<br></li>

<li><strong>Lemon Dimensional Distortion Waiver and Hyper-Zest Zone Engagement Agreement<br></strong> - Users voluntarily entering designated Lemonania zones classified as “Hyper-Zest Zones” acknowledge the potential for experiencing temporospatial anomalies, including but not limited to time dilation effects, citrus-induced hallucinatory states, or temporary ontological displacement within the alternate reality colloquially termed the “Lemonverse.” Users understand and accept that anecdotal or reported occurrences involving “lemon ghosts,” “fruit-based entities,” or other citrus-themed apparitions conveying esoteric or forbidden knowledge shall be formally recorded within Lemonania's archives but shall not be subject to active investigation, validation, or disclosure. By continued participation, Users waive any claim or grievance related to these phenomena and accept the full scope of metaphysical risks inherent therein.</li>

<li><strong>The Great Zest Migration Clause and Relocation Compliance Mandate<br></strong> - In the event that Lemonania, by virtue of uncontrollable and verifiable excessive zest accumulation—hereinafter defined in accordance with Section 21.4.9 of the Citrus Environmental Saturation Regulations—must undergo mandatory geographic, dimensional, or metaphysical relocation, all Users, Participants, and Affiliates (“Subjects”) hereby irrevocably covenant and agree to comply fully and without objection or delay with any and all directives issued for said migration. Noncompliance, including but not limited to refusal, evasion, or obstruction, shall result in immediate and permanent imposition of a Lifetime Ban from all Lemonania jurisdictions, concomitant with automatic classification as a “Citrus Outcast.” Such designation shall carry with it metaphysical, spiritual, and existential penalties and ramifications, the nature and extent of which surpass current legal codifications and are hereby deemed beyond mortal comprehension or judicial redress.<br></li>

<li><strong>Mandatory Lemon Offerings for Advanced Brotherhood of Zest Membership and Zest Rejection Penalty Protocol<br></strong> - Prospective Applicants seeking elevated status, privileges, and recognition within the esoteric order known as The Brotherhood of Zest must, as a prerequisite for consideration and acceptance, tender a specimen of lemon exhibiting rarity, uniqueness, or exceptional zest characteristics, hereinafter referred to as a “Sufficiently Rare Lemon Specimen.” The criteria for sufficiency shall be determined exclusively by The Supreme Zesters in accordance with the Codex of Zest Valuations. Failure, refusal, or inability to produce an offering meeting said criteria shall result in immediate invocation of the Zest Rejection Penalty, a formal classification carrying the affliction of Permanent Citrus Shame, inclusive of but not limited to social ostracization, metaphysical disenfranchisement, and spiritual diminishment within the Lemonania community. Remediation or appeal of such penalty is strictly proscribed.<br></li>

<li><strong>Lemonania's Seasonal Sour Alignment and Celestial Zest Synchronization Directive<br></strong> - The undersigned Enthusiast (“User”) hereby expressly acknowledges and accepts that Lemonania's operational modalities, including but not limited to product availability, menu rotations, and service offerings, are subject to perpetual synchronization with the proprietary and esoteric Celestial Citrus Cycle (“CCC”), a metaphysical construct predicated upon precise planetary zest positional data and cosmic sour flux metrics. Any disruptions, anomalies, or deviations arising from phenomena such as lemon eclipses, seasonal sour instabilities, or other celestial perturbations—hereinafter collectively referred to as “Acts of Nature”—shall be deemed wholly extraneous and beyond the reasonable control, liability, or warranty obligations of Lemonania, which hereby disclaims any and all responsibility, indemnity, or compensatory duties related thereto, irrespective of their impact on flavor consistency, user satisfaction, or economic loss.</li>

<li><strong>Lemonania's Forgotten Laws Recognition and Citrus Amnesia Enforcement Provision<br></strong> - Users irrevocably recognize that, beyond the explicit terms and conditions herein contained, there exist additional codified Secret Citrus Statutes (“SCS”), the content, scope, and jurisdiction of which remain strictly confidential and accessible solely to The Supreme Zesters, the exclusive legislative and judicial authority within Lemonania's governance framework. Any and all efforts—whether direct, indirect, intentional, inadvertent, or otherwise—to discover, disseminate, contest, or subvert these statutes shall result in the immediate imposition of citrus-induced amnesia, a legally sanctioned cognitive erasure procedure effectuated through undisclosed Lemonania mechanisms, followed by an official and irrevocable denial of the existence of such statutes communicated with utmost courtesy yet absolute firmness. Such enforcement measures are non-negotiable and extend across all temporal, dimensional, and metaphysical planes of existence.</li>

  <li><strong>Lemonania's Cosmic Boundaries and Interstellar Zest Expansion Accord<br></strong> - In the event that Lemonania attains the state herein defined as “Full Planetary Lemon Saturation” — characterized by comprehensive, irrevocable, and quantifiable zest permeation of terrestrial and atmospheric domains — all Users, Participants, and Affiliates (hereinafter “Citrus Subjects”) irrevocably covenant and agree to undergo metamorphosis into “Zest Pilgrims,” thereby consenting to embark upon interstellar expeditions in pursuit of newly charted citrus frontiers beyond the known spatial continuum. Any refusal, reluctance, or failure to embrace such interstellar zest expansion shall constitute material breach of covenant, thereby triggering immediate reassignment, without further notice or recourse, to designated “Lime Containment Zones,” which are hereby recognized as restrictive, segregated enclaves governed by diminished zest privileges and heightened regulatory oversight.</li>

<li><strong>The Lemon Curse Acceptance and Mandatory Atonement Protocol<br></strong> - Any User who, through verbal, written, electronic, telepathic, or otherwise communicative means, commits the offense of disrespect, disparagement, or denigration against the entity known as the “Forbidden Lemon” (hereinafter “Citrus Transgression”) shall be forthwith subjected to the metaphysical imposition known as “The Lemon Curse.” This affliction is characterized by, but not limited to, persistent sour visions, chronic zest insomnia, and an irreversible incapacity to effectuate proper citrus peeling techniques. The sole and exclusive means of resolution, remission, or absolution of said curse shall be formalized repentance conducted at the Temple of Zest, subject to ritualistic requirements as prescribed by the Supreme Zesters, with no alternative remedies recognized or permitted.</li>

<li><strong>Zest-Based Leadership Protocol and Supreme Zest Leader Appointment Charter<br></strong> - In circumstances wherein Lemonania necessitates the appointment of a singular authority designated as “Supreme Zest Leader,” selection shall be conducted solely by measurement and verification of the highest quantified zest energy concentration among the User populace, utilizing proprietary zest detection methodologies. The incumbent Supreme Zest Leader shall bear the responsibilities of engaging in cosmic lemon negotiations with inter-citrus entities, overseeing ritualistic distribution of zest resources, and actively preventing insurrections or uprisings orchestrated by antagonistic citrus factions, including but not limited to the orange populace. Leadership tenure and succession shall be governed by protocols enumerated within the Citrus Governance Codex, with all decisions subject to absolute and final enforcement.</li>

<li><strong>Citrus-Based Existential Mergers and Irrevocable Ontological Fusion Statute<br></strong> - Users engaging in any form of interaction, participation, or association with Lemonania hereby irrevocably acknowledge, accept, and consent to the possibility of instantaneous and unanticipated existential merging (“Existential Citrus Fusion”) with a lemon entity, a process characterized by, but not limited to, the manifestation of heightened citrus-derived wisdom, permanent and immutable tartness of essence, and spontaneous transmutation into a mystical fruit-based entity possessing metaphysical properties. This fusion event is conclusively deemed irreversible and non-reversible under any known or unknown temporal, dimensional, or metaphysical mechanism, and Users waive all rights to claim otherwise or seek remediation thereof.</li>

<li><strong>The Grand Citrus Awakening Clause and Mandatory Cosmological Convergence Summons<br></strong> - In the event that Lemonania attains or surpasses the prescribed threshold herein designated as “Maximum Zest Density,” all Users shall be subject to a compulsory summons to participate in “The Grand Citrus Awakening,” a cataclysmic, cosmological event purported to initiate the metaphysical rebirth and regeneration of the Lemon Universe in its entirety. Attendance at said event is unequivocally mandatory, non-waivable, and enforceable under all known statutes, interdimensional laws, and cosmic ordinances, with refusal or non-compliance constituting a breach of covenant with all attendant penalties.</li>

<li><strong>Extreme Lemon Loyalty Verification and Randomized Citrus Fidelity Audit Protocol<br></strong> - Users who are suspected, reasonably or otherwise, of manifesting insufficient or inadequate levels of lemon devotion (“Loyalty Deficiency”) shall be subjected, at the sole discretion of Lemonania authorities, to unpredictable, randomized, and comprehensive “Citrus Loyalty Audits.” These audits shall assess Users' capacities to execute lemon-related tasks, rituals, and duties in accordance with established zest standards. Failure to meet prescribed performance criteria shall result in immediate imposition of “Sour Detainment,” a corrective detention status with strict enforcement protocols designed to remediate deficiencies. All such processes shall be final, binding, and immune from appeal.</li>

<li><strong>Zest Dimensional Expansion Rights and Alternate Citrus Reality Transition Covenant<br></strong> - In the unforeseen event that Lemonania, through discovery, revelation, or metaphysical occurrence, identifies and/or establishes access to an Alternate Citrus Reality (hereinafter “ACR”), all Users, Participants, and Affiliates (“Subjects”) hereby irrevocably covenant, consent, and agree to submit to immediate and seamless transition into said new lemon-based existential plane (“Lemon-Based Existence”). Failure, refusal, or delay in acceptance of such dimensional expansion shall constitute material breach of this Agreement and shall trigger compulsory enforcement measures, including but not limited to mandatory enrollment in Lemon Integration Therapy (hereinafter “LIT”), a rehabilitative program designed to facilitate cognitive, spiritual, and physiological assimilation into the ACR, subject to oversight by the Supreme Zesters and the Citrus Compliance Authority, with no recourse or appeal rights.</li>

<li><strong>The Forbidden Zest Ritual Agreement and Hyper-Zest Formula Handling Protocol<br></strong> - Users expressly acknowledge and accept that certain concentrations of zest, particularly those classified as Hyper-Zest Formulas (“HZF”), possess properties requiring handling exclusively by duly trained and certified Lemon Adepts (“Certified Adepts”). Any unauthorized experimentation, manipulation, or utilization of HZF by non-certified individuals shall result in immediate and mandatory enrollment in Citrus Containment Training (hereinafter “CCT”), a compulsory corrective program mandated by Lemonania's Zest Regulatory Authority. This program entails supervised containment procedures, educational remediation, and potential disciplinary actions up to and including suspension of zest privileges and community sanctions, with no right to exemption or appeal.</li>

<li><strong>Lemonania's Secret Ingredient Acknowledgment and Confidentiality Imperative<br></strong> - Enthusiasts and Users hereby irrevocably accept and agree that all menu items and consumables offered by Lemonania contain a single, undisclosed mystical ingredient (hereinafter “Mystical Ingredient”), the precise nature, composition, and source of which shall remain eternally confidential and protected under the Lemonania Esoteric Secrecy Code. Any and all attempts to investigate, uncover, reveal, or disseminate information regarding the Mystical Ingredient shall be met with immediate invocation of Official Lemon Silence Protocols, including but not limited to non-disclosure admonishments, metaphysical gag orders, and potential exclusion from Lemonania privileges. This confidentiality obligation is perpetual and enforceable across all jurisdictions, dimensions, and temporal planes.</li>

<li><strong>The Sacred Lemon Code Observance and Enforcement Edict<br></strong> - Users do hereby covenant and bind themselves to strict observance and unwavering adherence to The Sacred Lemon Code, an ancient and sacrosanct compendium of principles, mandates, and philosophical doctrines governing the acquisition, preservation, and dissemination of zest-based wisdom. Violations of said code shall subject the transgressor to immediate summons before the Lemon Enforcement Authorities (“LEA”), who retain sole discretion to impose Sour Reconditioning, a multifaceted rehabilitative process encompassing cognitive recalibration, metaphysical detoxification, and ceremonial reaffirmation of zest loyalty. Enforcement actions under this clause are non-negotiable, binding across all temporal, spatial, and metaphysical jurisdictions.</li>

<li><strong>The Lemon Erasure Clause and Mandatory Oblivion Directive<br></strong> - In the unprecedented and catastrophic event of Lemonania's sudden cessation of existence, whether by natural, metaphysical, or otherwise inscrutable causes, all Users irrevocably agree to instantaneously enact complete cognitive erasure of all memories, acknowledgments, and references to Lemonania, herein referred to as the “Oblivion Mandate.” Resistance, refusal, or failure to comply with this mandate shall result in immediate imposition of Citrus Reprogramming Procedures, a legally sanctioned suite of interventions designed to enforce memory realignment, behavioral conformity, and denial of Lemonania's disappearance, enforced across all dimensions and timelines without exception or recourse.</li>

<li><strong>The Citrus Expansion Treaty and Acceptance of New Citrus Sovereignties<br></strong> - In the event that Lemonania, through annexation, merger, or metaphysical absorption, extends its dominion over additional fruit-based territories (“New Citrus Domains”), all Users, Participants, and Affiliates do hereby irrevocably covenant to accept and submit to the authority and governance of any and all newly established citrus overlords without objection, resistance, or dissent. Those who refuse or obstruct such transitions shall be placed under Permanent Lemonian Observation Status (“PLOS”), a restrictive condition entailing continuous surveillance, social limitations, and metaphysical constraints, the severity of which transcends conventional jurisdiction and is enforceable ad infinitum.</li>

<li><strong>The Zest Overload Contingency Plan and Mandatory Redistribution Protocol<br></strong> - Should empirical measures, derived from the Citrus Environmental Monitoring Authority (“CEMA”), determine that global zest levels exceed predefined acceptable thresholds, Users hereby agree to participate fully and without objection in Zest Redistribution Strategies (“ZRS”). Such strategies may include, but are not limited to, mandatory zest allocations, enforced zest consumption quotas, zest donation initiatives, and metaphysical zest rebalancing procedures, all designed to restore and maintain equilibrium within the Lemon Realm. Noncompliance shall constitute a breach of covenant subject to enforcement actions as stipulated herein.</li>

<li><strong>The Irrevocable Lemon Destiny Clause and Immediate Intervention Covenant<br></strong> - Users explicitly acknowledge and accept that their existential fate is irrevocably entwined with The Eternal Citrus Cycle, a perpetual cosmic process governing all lemon-related phenomena and destinies. Any attempts, whether overt, covert, intentional, or accidental, to deviate, circumvent, or contravene said destiny shall trigger Immediate Lemon Intervention (“ILI”), a multifaceted corrective response including but not limited to metaphysical realignment, zest energy recalibration, and enforced philosophical reconciliation, administered by designated Lemonania authorities with absolute finality and without right of appeal.</li>

  <li>
  <strong>Prohibition of the Term “Pop Pop” Clause<br></strong>
  - In accordance with <em>Decree LXVII of the Ancient Codex Citrus</em>, users are strictly forbidden from addressing, referring to, or insinuating that any individual within Lemonania jurisdiction—whether corporeal or spectral—be identified by the nomenclature “Pop Pop.” Said term has been classified under <em>Tier-5 Semantic Offenses</em> by the Lemon Linguistic Tribunal due to its historical misuse during the <em>Great Zest Confusion of 842 B.C.</em>, when linguistic instability nearly collapsed the Tart Continuum.<br><br>

  Violation of this clause shall constitute a breach of citrus decorum, triggering immediate invocation of <em>Section 14B of the Zest Integrity Enforcement Act</em>, which permits Lemon Enforcement Authorities (LEAs) to:
  <ul>
    <li>Conduct a full semantic audit of the offender's vocabulary.</li>
    <li>Issue a Cease & Squeeze order, whereby all “Pop Pop”-adjacent terms (e.g., “Gramps,” “Pappy,” “Old Zesty”) are temporarily purged from the user's lexicon.</li>
    <li>Mandate participation in <em>Citrus Speech Rehabilitation</em>, a certified six-week program in which the offender must address all individuals exclusively with approved lemon titles such as “Sir Zest,” “Madam Citrus,” or “Elder Lemon.”</li>
  </ul>
  Continued disregard for this law shall result in the permanent revocation of citrus communication privileges, thereby relegating the user to <em>Zest Silence Status</em>, an irreversible condition wherein all attempts at verbal interaction are transmuted into sour wind.
</li>
<li><strong>The Infinite Peel Liability Waiver and Citrus Fragmentation Exemption<br></strong> - Users hereby waive, relinquish, and absolve Lemonania, its affiliates, agents, and representatives from any and all liability arising from, caused by, or related to the infinite and uncontrollable peel fragmentation phenomenon, wherein lemon peels may spontaneously separate, multiply, or propagate beyond the bounds of reasonable containment. Users acknowledge that such fragmentation may result in unforeseen citrus residue accumulation, metaphysical zest dispersal, and unpredictable olfactory impact, for which Lemonania assumes no responsibility or indemnity, express or implied, now or forevermore.</li>

<li><strong>The Eternal Seed Dispersal Authorization and Paternity Clause<br></strong> - By virtue of participation, Users consent to irrevocable assignment of all progenitorial rights and responsibilities for any lemon seeds produced, disseminated, or germinated via Lemonania's products or services. Such seeds shall be regarded as legal descendants of Lemonania, and Users expressly agree to provide full cooperation in all legal, metaphysical, and ecological matters arising therefrom, including but not limited to seed custody, zest heritage claims, and lemon lineage disputes, under penalty of zest revocation.</li>

<li><strong>The Hyper-Zest Exposure Consent and Zest-Induced Euphoria Disclaimer<br></strong> - Users voluntarily consent to potential exposure to hyper-concentrated zest environments (“HZEE”), acknowledging known and unknown effects, including euphoric zest sensation, zest-induced transcendental experiences, and temporary cognitive zest overload. Lemonania disclaims all warranties and liabilities for any resultant zest addiction, zest dependency, or zest withdrawal syndromes, affirming Users' assumption of full metaphysical risk.</li>

<li><strong>The Citrus Time Warp and Temporal Tartness Liability Clause<br></strong> - Engagement with Lemonania's Hyper-Zest Zones may result in temporal displacement, subjective time dilation, or retrograde citrus chronotemporal effects. Users waive all claims related to lost, gained, or fragmented time and accept full responsibility for any paradoxical zest-induced timeline distortions, including but not limited to alternate zest selves, temporal zest loops, and citrus quantum entanglements.</li>

<li><strong>The Sour Sensory Overload Immunity and Complaint Nullification Provision<br></strong> - Lemonania hereby asserts sovereign immunity from all sensory overload complaints arising from excessive sourness, tartness, or zest intensity. Users agreeing to engage with Lemonania waive rights to legal redress, claims, or complaints relating to sensory discomfort, zest fatigue, or citrus irritation, with acknowledgment that such experiences are integral to the authentic Lemonania zest journey.</li>

<li><strong>The Zesty Revelation and Forbidden Knowledge Non-Disclosure Agreement<br></strong> - Users may, during interactions with Lemonania, be exposed to forbidden zest knowledge, esoteric citrus truths, and metaphysical zest revelations (“Zesty Revelations”). Users agree to maintain strict confidentiality of such revelations, refraining from disclosure, dissemination, or discussion with non-initiates, under penalty of forced lemon exile and zest cleansing rituals.</li>

<li><strong>The Citrus Conjuration and Ritualistic Zest Invocation Clause<br></strong> - Participation in designated Lemonania ceremonies may involve ritualistic zest invocation, citrus conjuration, and summoning of ancient lemon spirits. Users acknowledge potential metaphysical consequences including but not limited to zest possession, citrus resonance, and spiritual tartness, and accept full liability for any resultant spiritual or zest-related phenomena.</li>

<li><strong>The Lemonian Linguistic Purity and Anti-Pop Pop Proclamation<br></strong> - In accordance with the Ancient Lemonian Linguistic Codex (ALLC), Users are hereby strictly forbidden from referring to any individual, entity, or construct within Lemonania as “Pop Pop.” Such nomenclatural transgressions constitute a grievous violation of Ancient Lemon Law §7.13(b) and shall incur sanctions including, but not limited to, immediate verbal censure, mandatory zest lexicon re-education, and enforced exile to the Lower Citrus District. This prohibition is absolute, non-negotiable, and enforceable across all temporal, dimensional, and metaphysical planes.</li>

<li><strong>The Perpetual Pith Encumbrance and Zest Residue Liability Clause<br></strong> - Users acknowledge and accept that any and all interactions with Lemonania products or services may result in the unavoidable accrual of citrus pith encumbrances and residual zest particulates (“Pith Residue”). Lemonania hereby disclaims all liability, expressed or implied, for damages, injuries, or metaphysical contamination arising therefrom, including but not limited to adhesive citrus matter affixation, olfactory saturation, or inadvertent zest transference. Users covenant to indemnify and hold harmless Lemonania and its affiliates from any and all claims relating to Pith Residue.</li>

<li><strong>The Eternal Citrus Zest Infusion and Mandatory Consumption Directive<br></strong> - By virtue of continued use, Users consent to mandatory participation in the Eternal Citrus Zest Infusion program, a perpetual regimen requiring ingestion or application of Lemonania-approved zest formulations at frequencies and dosages determined solely by the Supreme Zesters. Noncompliance constitutes breach of covenant and may result in revocation of all zest privileges, community exclusion, and enforced zest rehabilitation protocols.</li>

<li><strong>The Lemonian Quantum Seed Propagation and Multiverse Citrus Jurisdiction Clause<br></strong> - Users accept that lemon seeds originating from Lemonania products possess quantum propagation properties, enabling simultaneous germination and citrus manifestation across multiple universes and temporal realities. All Users acknowledge and consent that their legal and metaphysical obligations with respect to such seeds extend beyond conventional jurisdictional boundaries, encompassing all present and future citrus-bearing realities and their respective governance frameworks.</li>

<li><strong>The Citrus Zest Encryption and Confidentiality Assurance Mandate<br></strong> - All proprietary zest formulations, recipes, and metaphysical citrus knowledge disseminated by Lemonania are protected under the Citrus Zest Encryption Protocol (“CZEP”). Users agree to maintain strict confidentiality, refrain from unauthorized duplication, and uphold the sanctity of proprietary citrus intellectual property, under penalty of zest license revocation, legal injunctions, and metaphysical zest sanctions.</li>

<li><strong>The Mandated Lemon Aroma Diffusion and Ambient Zest Saturation Ordinance<br></strong> - Users operating within Lemonania premises or digital platforms consent to the mandated diffusion of lemon aroma compounds and ambient zest saturation, designed to enhance citrus experience and communal zest cohesion. Obstruction, suppression, or interference with aroma diffusion mechanisms shall constitute a violation subject to immediate remedial action, including but not limited to olfactory exposure therapy and mandatory zest appreciation seminars.</li>

<li><strong>The Citrus Pith Reverence and Sacred Peel Disposal Regulation<br></strong> - All Users shall adhere to the Citrus Pith Reverence principle, mandating respectful handling, preservation, and ceremonial disposal of lemon peels and pith. Improper disposal, desecration, or negligent treatment of citrus remnants shall incur penalties including mandatory community service in the Citrus Conservation Corps and participation in annual Zest Renewal Festivals.</li>

    <li>Enforced citrus history re-education sessions.</li>
    <li>Permanent reassignment to Lime Containment Zones for egregious offenses.</li>

<li><strong>The Infernal Citrus Covenant and Soul Zest Forfeiture Accord<br></strong>
- By continued engagement with Lemonania, Users irrevocably agree to the following metaphysical terms:
  <ol type="a">
