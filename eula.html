        <h2>Lemonania End User License Agreement (EULA)</h2>      
        <p>Welcome to Lemonania, the premier establishment dedicated to the obsessive admiration, consumption, and philosophical contemplation of lemons. By accessing, browsing, or attempting to engage with Lemonania, you hereby agree to abide by the following highly necessary and completely enforceable terms:</p>
        <ol>
  <li><strong>Absolute Lemon Allegiance<br></strong> – By accessing Lemonania, you hereby pledge your unwavering loyalty to lemons, acknowledging them as the superior fruit above all others. Any attempt to suggest that another citrus—such as an orange or grapefruit—holds equal status shall be considered an act of Citrus Treason. Violators may be subject to corrective measures, including forced zest immersion and indefinite exile from the Lemonania community. This clause is non-negotiable and binding across all dimensions of time and space.</li>
  <li><strong>Invisible Lemon Clause<br></strong> – The existence of invisible lemons is beyond dispute and recognized by Lemonania as an accepted truth. Purchases of invisible lemons are final, and any attempt to claim non-receipt will be dismissed with the legal argument of “You must believe.” Refunds shall not be issued under any circumstances, as quantum fruit ownership transcends traditional financial structures. You also acknowledge that attempting to perceive an invisible lemon may result in spontaneous philosophical revelations.</li>
  <li><strong>Zest Regulation Compliance<br></strong> – Users must maintain an acceptable level of enthusiasm for lemons at all times. The Lemon Council reserves the right to measure zest intensity through undisclosed methods and issue warnings for insufficient citrus devotion. Should corrective action be required, users may be enrolled in mandatory zest recalibration therapy, wherein they will be exposed to increasingly potent lemon formulations until proper reverence is demonstrated. Failure to comply may result in indefinite zest deficiency status, which carries social consequences too severe to list here.</li>
  <li><strong>Lemon Vault Access & Denial<br></strong> – The Lemon Vault is a classified entity, known only to The Supreme Zesters, who govern its existence with great secrecy. Any inquiries regarding its location, contents, or significance shall be summarily ignored, rejected, or permanently banned from discussion. Users attempting unauthorized entry will face swift repercussions, which may include forced re-education in citrus history and permanent reassignment to the Lesser Citrus Zone, where only limes reside.</li>
  <li><strong>Forbidden Lemon Consumption Disclaimer<br></strong> – Any individual who chooses to consume the Forbidden Lemon does so entirely at their own risk. Potential side effects may include hyper-awareness of citrus frequencies, uncontrollable zest vibrations, and accidental ascension into The Higher Lemon Consciousness. Lemonania assumes no responsibility for spontaneous existential shifts, nor will compensation be provided for loss of personal identity due to merging with the Lemon Essence.</li>
  <li><strong>Lemonania Merch Ownership Terms<br></strong> – Ownership of official Lemonania merchandise constitutes immediate enrollment into The Brotherhood of Zest, an ancient order bound by sacred lemon philosophy. Members are required to uphold the principles of Maximum Zest Conduct, display their merchandise with appropriate reverence, and engage in periodic ceremonial offerings to The Great Lemon Overseer. Any attempt to disregard the symbolic importance of Lemonania gear may lead to involuntary Citrus Expulsion Proceedings, a lengthy bureaucratic nightmare from which few have escaped unscathed.</li>
  <li><strong>Lemon-Based Economy Agreement<br>
  <strong>– Transactions within Lemonania adhere to the Lemon Bucks Standard, a financial system currently awaiting global recognition. While traditional currency is begrudgingly accepted, users are encouraged to adopt fruit-backed wealth practices, wherein lemon accumulation replaces conventional savings. Lemonania reserves the right to issue Lemon Tax Notices, wherein users may be required to contribute additional zest levels to maintain economic balance within the lemon economy.</strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong><strong>No Legal Action for Extreme Zest Exposure<br></strong> – <strong>Users willingly engaging with Lemonania assume full responsibility for any and all effects resulting from exposure to high-intensity zest environments. Documented cases include permanent citrus sensitivity, excessive devotion to tangy flavors, and unexpected transformations into Lemon Energy Beings. Legal complaints regarding zest-induced enlightenment will be dismissed without review.</strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong><strong>Mandatory Citrus Etiquette<br></strong> – Proper terminology must be observed at all times. Lemons are not to be referred to as “yellow limes,” “budget oranges,” or “sour potatoes.” Offenders will face immediate correction through Zest Restoration Protocols, including verbal reprimands, mandatory zest improvement sessions, and public acknowledgment of their lapse in citrus judgment. Repeated offenses may result in permanent zestlessness, a grim fate.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Eternal Agreement & Irrevocable Bond<br></strong> – This contract is permanent and cannot be revoked, nullified, or withdrawn. By continuing, users acknowledge that they are eternally bound to the principles, philosophy, and greater purpose of Lemonania. Attempts to disengage will result in an endless bureaucratic citrus loop, wherein all exit requests must be submitted in triplicate but will never be processed. This agreement transcends time, space, and reason.</li>
  <li><strong>Zest Frequency Compliance<br></strong> – Users acknowledge that Lemonania operates on a proprietary <strong>Citrus Frequency System</strong>, wherein lemons emit an energy signature measurable in <strong>zest units</strong>. Prolonged exposure may result in unexpected synchronization with <strong>The Greater Lemon Consciousness</strong>, for which Lemonania assumes no liability.</li>
  <li><strong>Lemon Dimensional Distortion Agreement<br></strong> – Users entering Lemonania’s <strong>Hyper-Zest Zones</strong> may experience <strong>time dilation, citrus-induced hallucinations, or temporary existence within the Lemonverse</strong>. Any reports of <strong>lemon ghosts</strong> or <strong>fruit-based entities whispering forbidden truths</strong> shall be documented but never investigated.</li>
  <li><strong>The Great Zest Migration Clause<br></strong> – Should Lemonania be required to relocate due to <strong>excessive zest accumulation</strong>, all users agree to follow without question. Failure to comply may result in a lifetime ban and automatic designation as a <strong>Citrus Outcast</strong>, which has spiritual ramifications beyond legal comprehension.</li>
  <li><strong>Mandatory Lemon Offerings<br></strong> – Users seeking advanced membership within <strong>The Brotherhood of Zest</strong> must present a <strong>sufficiently rare lemon specimen</strong> as tribute. Failure to produce an acceptable offering will result in <strong>Zest Rejection</strong>, a classification known to cause permanent citrus shame.</li>
  <li><strong>Lemonania’s Seasonal Sour Alignment<br></strong> – The Enthusiast acknowledges that Lemonania synchronizes itself with the <strong>Celestial Citrus Cycle, adjusting menu availability according to planetary zest positions. Disruptions caused by lemon eclipses or seasonal sour instability</strong> are considered <strong>acts of nature</strong>, and Lemonania holds no responsibility for flavor inconsistencies.</li>
  <li><strong>Lemonania’s Forgotten Laws<br></strong> – Users must acknowledge that beyond this agreement exist <strong>Secret Citrus Statutes</strong>, inaccessible to all except <strong>The Supreme Zesters</strong>. Any attempt to uncover or challenge these unknown laws shall result in immediate <strong>citrus-induced amnesia</strong>, followed by a polite but firm denial of existence.</li>
  <li><strong>Lemonania’s Cosmic Boundaries Clause<br></strong> – If Lemonania were to achieve <strong>full planetary lemon saturation</strong>, users agree to transition into <strong>Zest Pilgrims, journeying to the stars in search of <strong>new citrus frontiers. Those unwilling to embrace interstellar zest expansion may be reassigned to <strong>Lime Containment Zones</strong>.</strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong>The Lemon Curse Acceptance<br></strong> – Any user who verbally disrespects the Forbidden Lemon will be automatically subjected to <strong>The Lemon Curse</strong>, a phenomenon known to cause <strong>sour visions, zest insomnia, and the inability to properly peel citrus</strong>. Resolution requires formal repentance at the <strong>Temple of Zest</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Zest-Based Leadership Protocol<br></strong> – Should Lemonania require a <strong>Supreme Zest Leader</strong>, the role shall be assigned to the <strong>user with the highest zest energy concentration. Leadership responsibilities may include <strong>cosmic lemon negotiations, ritual zest distribution, and preventing orange uprisings</strong>.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Citrus-Based Existential Mergers<br></strong> – Users engaging with Lemonania must accept the possibility of <strong>sudden existential merging</strong> with a lemon. Symptoms include <strong>heightened citrus wisdom, permanent tartness, and spontaneous conversion into a mystical fruit entity</strong>. There is <strong>no reversal process for this event.</strong></li>
  <li><strong><strong>The Grand Citrus Awakening Clause<br></strong> – Should Lemonania reach the threshold of <strong>Maximum Zest Density</strong>, users will be summoned to <strong>The Grand Citrus Awakening</strong>, an event rumored to trigger <strong>the rebirth of the Lemon Universe. Attendance is mandatory.</strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong><strong>Extreme Lemon Loyalty Verification<br></strong> – Users suspected of <strong>insufficient lemon devotion</strong> may be subjected to <strong>randomized citrus loyalty audits</strong>, wherein their ability to perform lemon-related tasks shall be tested. Inadequate performance results in <strong>Immediate Sour Detainment</strong>.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Zest Dimensional Expansion Rights<br></strong> – In the event Lemonania discovers an <strong>Alternate Citrus Reality</strong>, all users agree to transition smoothly into this <strong>new lemon-based existence</strong>. Failure to accept the expansion may result in forced <strong>Lemon Integration Therapy</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>The Forbidden Zest Ritual Agreement<br></strong> – Users acknowledge that certain zest concentrations must be handled <strong>only by trained Lemon Adepts.</strong> Unauthorized experimentation with <strong>Hyper-Zest Formulas</strong> will result in mandatory enrollment in <strong>Citrus Containment Training</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Lemonania’s Secret Ingredient Acknowledgment<br></strong> – Enthusiasts must accept that all menu items contain <strong>one undisclosed mystical ingredient</strong>, the nature of which shall never be revealed. Attempts to determine the ingredient shall be met with <strong>official lemon silence</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>The Sacred Lemon Code<br></strong> – Users agree to uphold <strong>The Sacred Lemon Code, a set of principles guiding zest-based wisdom. Violators may be summoned for <strong>Sour Reconditioning</strong> at the discretion of <strong>Lemon Enforcement Authorities.</strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong>The Lemon Erasure Clause<br></strong> – Should Lemonania suddenly cease to exist, all users agree to <strong>forget it immediately and never acknowledge its disappearance</strong>. Those who resist will be subject to <strong>Citrus Reprogramming Procedures</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>The Citrus Expansion Treaty<br></strong> – If Lemonania absorbs additional fruit-based territories, users agree to <strong>accept new citrus overlords</strong> without resistance. Those who refuse shall be placed in <strong>Permanent Lemonian Observation Status</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>The Zest Overload Contingency Plan<br></strong> – Should global zest levels exceed acceptable limits, users agree to participate in <strong>Zest Redistribution Strategies</strong>, ensuring balance is maintained throughout the Lemon Realm.</li>
  <li><strong>Irrevocable Lemon Destiny Clause<br></strong> – Users acknowledge that their fate is now permanently aligned with <strong>The Eternal Citrus Cycle</strong>. Attempts to deviate from this destiny will be corrected through <strong>Immediate Lemon Intervention</strong>.</li>
